There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums. 
Note that 1 = 0^2 + 1^2 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Given an input n, find the count of all the numbers less than n that are both palindromic and can be written as the
sum of consecutive squares.

For instance: values(1000) = 11. See test examples for more cases.

Good luck!
